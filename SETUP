VMware Command Line Interface Tool

This tool implements the common tasks associated with managing a virtual machine
(vm) in the VMware environment.

vcli was written in Python 2.7 using pyvmomi 6.7.

vcli utilizes these python modules.  You can install them using the pip command.

    Required Python Modules:
        netaddr
        pycryptodome
        pyvmomi
        requests
        urllib3
        vapi-client-bindings
        vapi-common-client
        vapi-runtime

Once all required modules have been installed copy the vcli compoents to its
appropriate directory.

    File        Description
    ----        -----------
    vcli        wrapper script, copy to executable directory in PATH,
                e.g.  /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin, etc...
    VCLI.py     vcli class module that implements the vcli toolset.
                This module is imported by the vcli wrapper script.
                This module should be copied to the site-packages directory,
                e.g.  /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/

                Note:  It is highly recommended that the module is compiled first.
                       [root]# python -m py_compile VCLI.py
                       This will create a compiled object code, VCLI.pyc.
                       Copy this file VCLI.pyc, instead of the source file VCLI.py.

VCenter Login
A configuration file name .vcli.conf is needed to provided vcenter
authentication.  The vcli tool will search for the .vcli.conf file in
your HOME directory or system configuration directory /etc/.

The .vcli.conf file contains four key information:
    Key     Value
    ---     -----
    host    Hostname of the vcenter
    port    Port vcenter is listening on.
    username   Account used to connect to vcenter.
    password   Encrypted password to account, see below for example.
               Note:  This field is required for seamless operations.
                      If omitted vcli will prompt for password.
    
Sample .vcli.conf file
    [root]# cat .vcli.conf
    vcenter:
        host: 'vcenter.example.com'
        port: 443
        username: 'dn220'
        password: 'UORhs+sUeMnBi6WCJhA0t2UudxJbsqJunONoJf8A2/R6yWa3cR5PiR28LKf5jBEH'
    [root]#

Encrypting password for .vcli.conf
    [root]# vcli encrypt
    Password to Encrypt:
    Encrypted ciphertext: UORhs+sUeMnBi6WCJhA0t2UudxJbsqJunONoJf8A2/R6yWa3cR5PiR28LKf5jBEH
